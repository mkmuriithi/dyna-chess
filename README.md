# dyna-chess


## Motivation

What happens when you take *Good Ol' Fashioned AI*, Statistical Models, Neural Networks, and throw them all at the game of chess. Well, you get this project :)

The goal of this project is to create a single player game of chess (i.e. player vs computer), where the player can play against a computer with various configurable underlying AI models (e.g. Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, etc.)

As a following stage, a *computer vs computer* mode (with an accompanying API) may follow, allowing users to run simulations and AIs of their creation battle it out with AIs provided in this project.
